AIRR Community Software WG Gold Standard Datasets
=============================

Summary
============
We are trying to identify AIRRseq datasets that can be used as a gold standards for test and validate analysis tools. Questions/problems that we would like to address are filed as issues for discussion of the best types of datasets to use for those analyses. Both real and simulated data will be added to the repository as they are identified.
